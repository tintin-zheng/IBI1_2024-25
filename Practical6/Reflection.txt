This week's practical was quite challenging, but I found it incredibly exciting.
I learned more about programming and created a disease spread model that is closely related to the real world. 
I realized that similar complex models are extremely useful in real-life disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19. 
This made me feel that the knowledge I'm learning is highly practical, which greatly motivated me!  

Additionally, beyond just meeting the requirements, 
I explored how to make Matplotlib generate animation, making my program more intuitive and user-friendly.  

Of course, I still have many ideas to explore, such as allowing vaccinated individuals to have a certain probability of infection,
multiple outbreak points, and introducing reinfection probabilities for recovered individuals.  

In the future, I plan to further explore these ideas and continue improving my program.
