**error_1**:

**description**: There is a commented line that says what the code does: Generates pair of random numbers between 1 and 6 until two identical numbers are found. Reports how many iterations this took.

The answer is mostly correct, but you didn't mention it was numbers between 1 and 6.

**changes**:
Answer: Using the computer to creat two random integers **(range from 1-6)**, to see whether they are the equal and record the number of attempts.
